Modernized Minpack

![Build Status](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/minpack/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)

### Description

Minpack includes software for solving nonlinear equations and
nonlinear least squares problems.  Five algorithmic paths each include
a core subroutine and an easy-to-use driver.  The algorithms proceed
either from an analytic specification of the Jacobian matrix or
directly from the problem functions.  The paths include facilities for
systems of equations with a banded Jacobian matrix, for least squares
problems with a large amount of data, and for checking the consistency
of the Jacobian matrix with the functions.

This version is a modernization of the original Fortran 77 code. This is a work in progress. Modifications include:
* Conversion from fixed (`.f`) to free-form (`.f90`) source.
* Modified the tests so they can be automatically run in the [CI](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/minpack/actions)

Further updates are planned...

### Documentation

 * The API documentation for the current ```master``` branch can be found [here](https://jacobwilliams.github.io/minpack/).  This is generated by processing the source files with [FORD](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford).
